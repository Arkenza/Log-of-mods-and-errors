ROCKETMAN: Hijacking ([REFLECTED] RimWorld.StatWorker:GetValue, [DECLARING] RimWorld.StatWorker:GetValue, [ISSTATIC] False, [ISPUBLIC] False, [ISVIRTUAL] StatWorker, [ABSTRACT] False)
[BetterLoading] Obtained synclock, assuming post-load actions are complete and starting static constructors.
[BetterLoading] Starting Antifreeze(tm) StaticConstructorCaller. Synchronizing retransmission chronicity...
[BetterLoading] Finished stage Running Post Content Load Callbacks at 7:59:24 PM.
[BetterLoading] Starting stage Finalizing Mods.
[BetterLoading] One or more mods have Harmony-Postfixed StaticConstructorOnStartupUtility#CallAll. This is likely to cause errors or undesired behavior, as BetterLoading changes this method to be called from another Thread than the UI one. A list of patches follows. 
(Filename: C:\buildslave\unity\build\Runtime/Export/Debug/Debug.bindings.h Line: 39)

[BetterLoading] In addition, when BetterLoading is installed, this postfix will run before any static constructors do, so it likely will not behave as the modder intended anyway.

(Filename: C:\buildslave\unity\build\Runtime/Export/Debug/Debug.bindings.h Line: 39)

[BetterLoading] Modders: Consider either loading this data on world load, using a regular static constructor but asking your users to put the mod last in the load order, or if it MUST be done now, consider using BetterLoading API to detect the start of StageRunPostFinalizeCallbacks, which fires once static constructors are done.

[BetterLoading] Players: I'm not interested in this warning, if a mod is breaking, show this message to the person who made that mod, not to me. They can reach out to me if they need assistance.
